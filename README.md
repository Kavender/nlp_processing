# NLP Toolkit
List of resources dedicated to cover common utility functions used for NLP related projects

This repository contains examples and best practices for building NLP systems, provided as Jupyter notebooks and utility functions. It's going to provide SOTA solutions that are commonly occurs in practice when work on problems involving text and language.

# Overview
The main goal is to reduce the chance of reproduce the code across different projects and simplify the code development experience. Besides, the example notebooks would serve as small portfolio projects and usage of the tools in a wide variety of real-world application.
With belief in pretrained models as a unified solution to many real-world problems, we will prioritize to build or rely on corresponding dependencies, as they achieve state-of-the-art results on several NLP benchmarks or have established NLP pipeline framework.

# Contents
The following cognitive services offer simple solutions to address common NLP tasks:
* [KeyPhrase Extraction](#extract-noun-phrases)
